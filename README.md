# Elite politics in the 1950s
This code is intended for analyzing the network relation of bureaucratic elites across the central and local echelon in the CCP regime during the early 1950s. 
Before 1956 when the 8th Party Congress convened, party elites were largely recruited from the military cadres who conducted war operations in the regime takeover.
They mostly acted as the party chiefs in the "regional" echelon and became influential political figures in the CCP politics, which might threaten the dominance 
of the central leadership. Dynamics of centralization proceeded from 1949 to 1956 thus suggested the efforts of central leaders in promoting
the regime centralization and regime security, i.e., weakening the role of regional military leaders.
